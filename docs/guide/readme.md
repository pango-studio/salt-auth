# Salt Auth0 Package Configuration

This package helps with using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as your Laravel app's authentication provider. It provides a bunch of methods for interacting with Auth0 APIs as well as a custom user repository which will automatically create and update user models when you login via Auth0.

## Installing Auth0 and setting up config variables

Install the `auth0/login package`:

```bash
composer require auth0/login
```

Publish the Auth0 config variables:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish

# Look through the list for Auth0\Login\LoginServiceProvider and type in the corresponding number
Which provider or tag's files would you like to publish?:
1
```

You will need values for the following variables in your `.env` file:

```env
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
AUTH0_DOMAIN
AUTH0_DB_CONNECTION

API_MACHINE_AUDIENCE
AUTH0_MACHINE_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_MACHINE_CLIENT_SECRET
AUTH0_MACHINE_DOMAIN
```

These variables are read by `config/laravel-auth0.php` as well as `config/core.php`. The values can be retrieved from the Auth0 applications on the management dashboard.

In `config/auth.php`, change the driver for the users authentication provider to be 'auth0':

```php
// config/auth.php
<?php
    ...
    'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'auth0',
            'model' => App\Models\User::class,
        ],
    ],

```

## Binding the custom user repository

You will need to bind a class that provides the app's User model each time a user is logged in or a JWT is decoded. This package provides a class, `CustomUserRepository` which serves this purpose. Add the following to `register()` method in `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php


<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(
            \Auth0\Login\Contract\Auth0UserRepository::class,
            \Salt\Core\Repositories\CustomUserRepository::class
        );
    }
}

```

## Setting up login routes

You need a callback route and a controller method to handle the authentication data from Auth0's server. You will also need /login and /logout routes to handle logging in and out of the app.

Run the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:controller Auth/Auth0IndexController
```

And populate the controller file with this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect;

class Auth0IndexController extends Controller
{
    public function login()
    {
        if (Auth::check()) {
            return redirect()->intended('/');
        }

        return App::make('auth0')->login(
            null,
            null,
            ['scope' => 'openid name email email_verified'],
            'code'
        );
    }

    public function logout()
    {
        Auth::logout();

        $logoutUrl = sprintf(
            'https://%s/v2/logout?client_id=%s&returnTo=%s',
            config('laravel-auth0.domain'),
            config('laravel-auth0.client_id'),
            config('app.url')
        );

        return Redirect::intended($logoutUrl);
    }
}

```

Add the following routes in `routes/web.php`:

```php

<?php

use Auth0\Login\Auth0Controller;
use App\Http\Controllers\Auth\Auth0IndexController;

Route::get('/auth0/callback', [Auth0Controller::class, 'callback'])->name('auth0-callback');
Route::get('/login', [Auth0IndexController::class, 'login'])->name('login');
Route::get('/logout', [Auth0IndexController::class, 'logout'])->name('logout');
```

## Changes to the User model

This package comes with a `User` model which inherits the traits provided by the package and sets up a lot of the necessary boilerplate stuff. To save you from having to re-add all of this yourself on the `User` model, you can change it be the following:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Salt\Core\Models\User as CoreUser;

class User extends CoreUser
{

}

```

## User database migration

The easiest way to get the right database fields is to delete the `create_users_table` migration that comes with a fresh laravel installation and then run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=core-migrations
```

You will then have a new `create_users_table` migration with the fields expected by this package. If that is not possible, you will need to add a new migration which adds a nullable `sub` string column to your users table
